# Prometheus_project
In this project I'm running API and Prometheus servers using docker-compose.

For using this repo you must have a docker daemon running on your local computer, make sure that docker-compose version is 1.24 or above.
* Run the command "docker-compose up -d"
* Open your web brwoser and navigate to the url "http://127.0.0.1:9090"
* Now you will see your Prometheus console. 
* Enjoy :)
